# 2025-12-16: joins MVP + regression fix

## Meta
- Date (UTC): 2025-12-16 11:59
- Agent: GPT-5.2 (Codex CLI)
- Goal: Make the new Joins milestone actually work (and restore `information_schema` queries).

## Changes
- Fixed `information_schema` being incorrectly treated as a blocked “system schema” during FROM/JOIN scanning (`src/sql.rs`).
- Hardened multi-table column resolution:
  - Track ambiguous unqualified column names (e.g. `id` in two tables) and error instead of silently picking one.
  - Resolve qualified names (`table.col`, `db.table.col`) consistently for expressions and `ORDER BY` (`src/sql.rs`).

## TODO.md Updates
- Touched: `0) Current State (What Exists Today)` (multi-table SELECT subset).
- Touched: `9.2) Operators -> Joins` (checked nested-loop INNER JOIN).

## Verification
- `cargo test --all --all-features`

## Notes / Follow-ups
- Only INNER JOIN + comma joins are supported; no aliases/outer joins/optimizer yet.
